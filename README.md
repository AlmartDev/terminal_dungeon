This engine was used to power a maze solving robot during Advent of Code 2019:

* **'esc'** to exit

* **'t'** to turn off textures

* **'wasdqe'** or arrow-keys to move

* **'space'** to jump

* **'f'** to Shoot

* **'g'** take 14 hp

* **'h'** heal 25 hp

***********
Depending on your terminal font, Renderer.ascii_map may need to be adjusted.

Values stored in wall textures should range from 0-9. 6 is the default wall shade; values below 6 will darken the wall and above 6 will lighten it.
